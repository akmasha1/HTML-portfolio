<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello, my name is Ekene and I am a self-taught web developer from Nigeria. I have always been passionate about technology and the internet, and I taught myself how to code by reading online tutorials and practicing on my own.
  I am excited to start using my skills in the real world and contribute to the development of innovative web applications. I believe that my self-taught background has given me a unique perspective and ability to solve problems creatively. <br />
  I am constantly learning and expanding my knowledge and I am eager to work with others who share my passion for web development. I am confident that I can bring value to any team and contribute to the success of any project. <br />
  Thank you for considering me for any opportunities that may arise.
